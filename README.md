# Mount Connect

## Objective

Design an advanced trekkong pole with an ability to connect other trekking pole with the help of Long-Range technology.

## Abstract 
When people go on trekking, there is no way to communicate with the other people. so, we propose a LoRa based local mesh network system through which people on different location on the trek can communicate through text messages and share GPRS location in text message. Basically, LoRa modules have a special ability of extremely long range. Its node length can go up to 10 Km. we will embed the whole setup in the pole.

## Framework
 ###  * Arduino IDE ,ESP Module 8266 , Node MCU , LoRa Module
